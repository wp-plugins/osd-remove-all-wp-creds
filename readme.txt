OSD Remove All WP Branding Plugin is a quick way to remove almost every mention of Wordpress on your site.

== Description ==

OSD Remove All WP Branding Plugin is a quick way to remove almost every mention of Wordpress on your site. This is useful when you need a completely vanilla / brandless setup. This will be updated as Wordpress core changes. See "Other Notes" for a list of all the places that are effected. I think some will be happy with the removal of Wordpress in the title bar in the admin section.  If you wish to have a favicon in the admin screens, or your own logo on the login screen, please visit the settings page!

1. Upload the osd-remove-all-wp-creds directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
